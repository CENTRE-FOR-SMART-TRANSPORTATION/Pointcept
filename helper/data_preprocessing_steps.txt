1. write the pointclouds in the s3dis format
so a .txt file with x, y, z intensity
and a folder corresponding to that file, with txt files for each label containing the x,y,z,intensity of the points that have that label

once that is done, use the preproces s3dis script to write the files to the .pth preprocessed folder

then see how to train the model based on that
